[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yangmillstheory/mixin.a.lot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yangmillstheory/mixin.a.lot)

**mixin.a.lot** is a JavaScript mixin library implemented in [CoffeeScript](http://www.coffeescript.org).

Its only dependency is [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/). You can run it in [node](https://nodejs.org/), or in the [browser](http://browserify.org/), and install it via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mixin-a-lot).

Goals for `Mixins`: 

1. should be lightweight and immutable without a complex class hierarchy
2. [should be customizable with message hooks - not calls to `super`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance)
3. should not assume anything about the classes/objects they're being mixed into
4. should allow the mixed-into class to preserve the existing class hierarchy and MRO (method resolution order) 

Goals for mixing classes:

1. should be able to opt-out of some mixin functionality
2. should be able to attach hooks to the mixing process
3. should be able to attach hooks to individual mixin methods
4. [should know if they're misusing the API as early as possible](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2807375/2419669)

## Usage & Examples

### Install

Get the latest build:

    $ npm install mixin-a-lot
    
Import the module:

    var mixin_a_lot = require('mixin-a-lot');

### Make a mixin

Make a mixin; `name` and at least one other property is required. The only way to make new instances is through the factory.

    var logger = mixin_a_lot.make_mixin({
        name: "Logger",
        logname: "Default Logname",
        log: function(log_object) {
            ...
        },
    });

### Mix a mixin

Mix a mixin into your object, class or class's prototype. Mixins must be `Mixin` instances.

    var MyLogger = function() {};

    // mix into the Function
    mixin_a_lot.mix(MyLogger, mixin);
    // or mix into the prototype
    mixin_a_lot.mix(MyLogger.prototype, mixin);
    // or mix into a random object
    mixin_a_lot.mix({...}, mixin);

### <a name="mixin-method-hooks"></a> Mix options & mixin method hooks

A subset of mixin methods/properties can be omitted (but not all):
    
    mixin_a_lot.mix({...}, mixin, {
        omits: ['logname']
    });
    
You can request before and after hooks into mixin methods. They'll always be called the context bound to the mix target.

Return values are propagated [accordingly](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html#id2878339) - 
it's best to use an object or container class argument (as below) when propagating multiple return values.
    
    // the return value from this hook is passed to logger.log
    // 'this' is the MyLogger function. 
    var before_log = function(error) {
        var level, serialized;
    
        if (error instanceof Critical) {
            level = 'critical';
        } else if (error instanceof SyntaxError) {
            level = 'error';
        } ...
        
        serialized = this._serialize_error(error); 
        
        return {level: level, serialized_error: serialized}; 
    };
    mixin_a_lot.mix(MyLogger, {
        before_hook: {log: before_log, ...}
    });
    
    // return value from log is passed to this hook
    // 'this' is a MyLogger instance now
    var after_log = function(log_object) {
        // do something with log_object.level and 
        // log_object.serialized_error (assuming log_error returns it)
    };
    mixin_a_lot.mix(MyLogger.prototype, mixin, {
        after_hook: {log: after_log}
    });

### <a name="mixing-hooks"></a> Mixing hooks
    
`Mixins` can have pre-mixing and post-mixing hooks that fire before and after mixing (resp.) with the target context.

There are two not mutually exclusive ways to specify them. They can be attached to the mixin 

    var logger = mixin_a_lot.make_mixin({
        name: "Logger",
           
        // various methods that operate on this.logname    
        
        premix: function() {
            if (!this.logname) {
                throw new Error("Can't log without a logname!");
            }
        }
    });
   
or specified on a per-mixing basis via the options hash.  
    
    mixin_a_lot.mix(MyLogger.prototype, mixin, {
        postmix: function(arg1, arg2) {
            // do something useful; finalize the mixing.
            // `this` points to Thing.prototype;
            // arguments are optionally specified via an 
            // optional array as below
        };
    }, ['arg1', 'arg2']);
    
If specified in both places, the hooks from the options hash run before the ones from the mixin. 

`this` in mixing hooks always points to the mix target.

Optional arguments to the mixing hooks are passed via the third parameter.  

## API

Given the following setup:

    var m = require('mixin-a-lot');
    

### m.make_mixin(Object mixin_properties, [Boolean freeze])

Make a `Mixin` from an object literal with at least a `String name` property. 

If `freeze` is not false, `NotMutable` is thrown whenever there's an attempt to mutate a mixin property.

If `freeze` is false, the returned `Mixin` will still throw `NotMutable` for the supplied properties, but new properties can now be added and deleted.

`premix` and `postmix` can optionally be [supplied as above](#mixing-hooks), with aliases `premixing`, `premixing_hook`, and `postmixing`, `postmixing_hook`, resp.

The returned `Mixin` has a property `mixin_keys`, which is an `Array` of property names that will mix into a mixing class; of course, these names don't include `name`.

### <a name="mix"></a> m.mix({Object|Function} mixtarget, Mixin mixin, [Object options])

Mix properties from the Mixin into mixtarget, which should be a non-null `Object` or `Function`. Optional `options` should be an object literal conforming to the following schema:
 
* `omits`: `Array` of `Strings` which are properties of the mixin to exclude from mixing
* `before_hook`, `after_hook`: object literal mapping mixin method names to callbacks, which are invoked with appropriate context, [as above](#mixin-method-hooks).
    * **aliases:** `hook_before`, `hook_after`, resp. 
* `postmix`, `premix`: `Functions` that fire before and after the mixing process, [as above](#mixing-hooks).
    * **aliases:** `postmixing`, `postmixing_hook`, and `premixing`, `premixing_hook`, resp.

Mixing hooks defined via `options` are invoked before those mixing hooks defined in the mixin. `hook_args` are passed to supplied mixing hooks, if any.
